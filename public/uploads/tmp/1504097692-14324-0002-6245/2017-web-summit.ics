DESCRIPTION:In six years Web Summit grew from 400 to over 53\,000 attendees
  from more than 166 different countries. Web Summit has been called "the be
 st technology conference on the planet"\, but we think it's just different.
 \n\nThat difference works for our attendees\, ranging from Fortune 500 comp
 anies to the world's most exciting tech companies plus 2\,000 of the world'
 s leading media. Our speakers may be world class\, but our networking is "s
 imply legendary".\n\nWe're excited to return to Lisbon for the second time.
